# Subrub

Subrub is a user configurable AI assistant made in C that works on most modern operating systems. It uses Miniaudio for the recording and PocketSphinx for the transcription. It was designed using [Hack Club AI](h
ttps://ai.hackclub.com/proxy/v1/chat/completions) for the AI testing however the user can provide any URL. The LLM model can also be configured in the [configuration file](https://github.com/bowlofneighs/subrub/blob/main/documentation.md#configuration). Subrub uses LibCurl for
 communication with the URL and cJSON to parse the returned JSON.
