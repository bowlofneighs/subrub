 Subrub is an open source voice AI assistant made in C. It utilizes pocketSphinx for speech transcription and almost any AI to answer the query. It then uses speech dispatcher to vocalize the answer. It will have some amount of system integration with the user being able to define keywords in a config file that will run system commands. There is also a section of the config file dedicated to `spd-say` flags.
